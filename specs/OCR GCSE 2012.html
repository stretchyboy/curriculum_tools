            <h3>2.1.1 Fundamentals of computer systems</h3>
This topic introduces computer systems and provides a foundation for the remaining topics in this unit.<br>
Candidates should develop a mental model of a computer system which comprises hardware and <br>
software and in which:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>data is input and converted into the computer&apos;s internal representation by input devices</li>
                <li>the data is processed</li>
                <li>the results of the processing are converted from the computer&apos;s internal representation and output by an output device</li>
                <li>the data may be stored for later use or transmitted to another computer system, while it is still in 
the computer&apos;s internal representation.</li>
            </ul>


            <br>This model applies to the personal computer, but candidates should be aware of how it also applies to <br>
equipment which uses computer technology.<br>

            <h2>Unit A452: Practical investigation</h2>
This unit is designed to provide candidates with an opportunity to carry out a practical investigation <br>
into a computing issue and engage them with computing in the real world.<br>
The unit deliberately extends the candidate&apos;s work beyond the topics in Unit A451 in order to provide <br>
a stimulating experience.<br>
Candidates should study one from a range of topics which will be supplied by OCR. Candidates <br>
will be expected to carry out practical investigations of the topic and any supplementary research <br>
necessary to complete these investigations. They will produce a report in which the topic is analysed, <br>
justified and evaluated showing evidence of the practical work undertaken. <br>
The research component may involve some collaboration with other candidates in a group activity.<br>
Candidates will be expected to produce a report which will then be assessed under the four headings:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>practical activity</li>
                <li>effectiveness and efficiency of the solution</li>

                <li>testing, evaluation, judgements and conclusions.</li>

OCR will issue a range of assessment tasks each consisting of up to three sub tasks. The set of tasks <br>
within the controlled assessment will provide opportunities for the candidate to demonstrate practical <br>
ability to use the skills outlined in the specification for this unit.<br>
Candidates will need to create suitable algorithms which will provide a solution to the stated problem <br>
then code their solutions in a suitable programming language. The solutions must be tested at each <br>
stage to ensure they solve the stated problem using a suitable test plan with appropriate test data.<br>
The code must be suitably annotated to describe the process. Test results should be annotated to <br>
show how these relate to the code, the test plan and the original problem.<br>
Candidates will need to provide an evaluation of their solution based on the test evidence.<br>
There are no restrictions on the programming language chosen providing it has the features indicated <br>
within the specification. It is anticipated that the work for this unit will follow on from the programming <br>
elements in unit A451 and that the same programming language may, therefore, be appropriate. The <br>
tasks are set so that they can be completed in a wide range of languages including those frequently <br>
used to &#x2018;teach&apos; programming techniques including all forms of BASIC and C. There may be a question <br>
which states that the work must be completed within a specific package, if this is the case, that <br>
package will be available for free and legal download, for example &#x2018;SCRATCH&apos; from MIT and &#x2018;ALICE&apos; <br>
from Carnegie.<br>
