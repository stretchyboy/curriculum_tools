            <h3>2.1.1 Fundamentals of computer systems</h3>
This topic introduces computer systems and provides a foundation for the remaining topics in this unit.<br/>
Candidates should develop a mental model of a computer system which comprises hardware and <br/>
software and in which:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>data is input and converted into the computer's internal representation by input devices</li>
                <li>the data is processed</li>
                <li>the results of the processing are converted from the computer's internal representation and output by an output device</li>
                <li>the data may be stored for later use or transmitted to another computer system, while it is still in 
the computer's internal representation.</li>
            </ul>


            <br/>This model applies to the personal computer, but candidates should be aware of how it also applies to <br/>
equipment which uses computer technology.<br/>

            <h2>Unit A452: Practical investigation</h2>
This unit is designed to provide candidates with an opportunity to carry out a practical investigation <br/>
into a computing issue and engage them with computing in the real world.<br/>
The unit deliberately extends the candidate's work beyond the topics in Unit A451 in order to provide <br/>
a stimulating experience.<br/>
Candidates should study one from a range of topics which will be supplied by OCR. Candidates <br/>
will be expected to carry out practical investigations of the topic and any supplementary research <br/>
necessary to complete these investigations. They will produce a report in which the topic is analysed, <br/>
justified and evaluated showing evidence of the practical work undertaken. <br/>
The research component may involve some collaboration with other candidates in a group activity.<br/>
Candidates will be expected to produce a report which will then be assessed under the four headings:<br/>
            <li>practical activity</li>
            <li>effectiveness and efficiency of the solution</li>
            <li>technical understanding</li>

            <h2>Unit A453: Programming project</h2>
OCR will issue a range of assessment tasks each consisting of up to three sub tasks. The set of tasks <br/>
within the controlled assessment will provide opportunities for the candidate to demonstrate practical <br/>
ability to use the skills outlined in the specification for this unit.<br/>
Candidates will need to create suitable algorithms which will provide a solution to the stated problem <br/>
then code their solutions in a suitable programming language. The solutions must be tested at each <br/>
stage to ensure they solve the stated problem using a suitable test plan with appropriate test data.<br/>
The code must be suitably annotated to describe the process. Test results should be annotated to <br/>
show how these relate to the code, the test plan and the original problem.<br/>
Candidates will need to provide an evaluation of their solution based on the test evidence.<br/>
There are no restrictions on the programming language chosen providing it has the features indicated <br/>
within the specification. It is anticipated that the work for this unit will follow on from the programming <br/>
elements in unit A451 and that the same programming language may, therefore, be appropriate. The <br/>
tasks are set so that they can be completed in a wide range of languages including those frequently <br/>
used to ‘teach' programming techniques including all forms of BASIC and C. There may be a question <br/>
which states that the work must be completed within a specific package, if this is the case, that <br/>
package will be available for free and legal download, for example ‘SCRATCH' from MIT and ‘ALICE' <br/>
from Carnegie.<br/>
